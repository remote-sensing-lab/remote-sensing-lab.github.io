          I won the Graduate Teaching Award by the Department of Geography &
          Sustainability, UTK (2024) and the Graduate Teaching Award by the
          Harpur College of Arts and Sciences, Binghamton University (2017).

              skills in programming and GIS.”</i

              >“I really appreciate how prepared he is about every class. What
              he teaches are quite crucial and makes it easy to follow.
              Additionally, his YouTube channel helps phenomenally to follow the
              tough codes he teaches.”</i

              >“The way he explained every topic was something else, and I
              really liked how he made everything open source, which helps
              millions of students around the world.”</i

              continually enriches them with his own touch of innovation.”</i

          <li>
            <i
              >“Dr. Wu is the absolute best!!! He's so student-oriented and
              helpful! I didn't think programming or coding was something I
              could ever do, but he made it possible! We all love him!”</i

          <li>
            <i
              >“Dr. Wu made himself available all the time and made sure to
              allow students to ask questions before continuing. He is an
              excellent teacher and I consider him a friend and mentor.”</i

              moment in class. Always makes students feel appreciated and
              welcomed.”</i

              subject matter. Pushes students to achieve more than they ever
              thought was possible. Always approachable and supportive.”</i

          <li>
            <i
              >“Dr. Wu is an awesome guy, and someone I honestly look to as a
              standard of professionalism and self-motivation. I highly
              recommend him as a professor to anyone in the Geography
              Department. He knows pretty much everything about ArcGIS,
              programming, stats … you name it. Thanks to him, I’ve learned much
              more about my field and topics I had tried to tackle on my own to
              no avail.”</i

          </li>
          <li>
            <i
              >“It’s honestly not hard to see why professor Wu would win such a
              prestigious award. He is fiercely intelligent, yet humble. He is
              genuinely devoted to his job and goes above and beyond to make
              sure his students are prepared to succeed.”</i
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <i
              >“Dr. Wu, I just wanted to thank you for giving me the opportunity
              to learn Python. It has come in handy so many times in my new
              position as a GIS Analyst. I am able to solve data integration and
              standardizing issues that otherwise would make processes
              impossible. So thank you very much!!”</i
